TC Server Embedded Example

* PURPOSE

To demonstrate basic embedded tcruntime with tcserver using the vFabric Commercial Maven Repository.

* REQUIREMENTS
- Maven 2.2.1 installed

* PRE-BUILD
Optional: Create your own unique commercial maven repository URL at repository.cloudfoundry.com and modify the repository tags located in the pom.xml to use your unique repo URL.
DEFAULT: It will use a temporary repo by jkonicki@vmware.com.

* BUILD
mvn clean compile assembly:single

* USAGE

java -jar target/example-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar 

This will startup a self contained tcruntime instance with a "Hello, World" webapp. There will be no file creation on dist. It will listen on port 1099 for incoming jmx connections
